# CodyAI - Learning in Process

A repository storing my learnings and work on GPT models, AI architecture, and other happenings as I try to figure all this stuff out. :P  

## Current Work

[CodyAI](https://github.com/holdmydata/CodyAI) - Writing a GPT model from scratch. Using [Andrej Karpathy's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), will build off of this as I work toward a personal AI model. Notes added for my own learning.
## Next Steps
1. Understanding the encoder architecture, learn how it works, and add to model.
2. Research and build backend memory for the model. Vectorize dimensional databases. 
3. Panel/UI package for model training and evaluation.
