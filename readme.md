# CodyAI - Learning in Process

A repository storing my learnings and work on GPT models, AI architecture, and other happenings as I try to figure all this stuff out. :P  

## Current Work
##### *The beginnings of a GPT model:*
![It's sentient...](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/707638742080553061/1099771552435802225/image.png)
- 4/23/2023 
    - Added validation to the model (very barebone)
    - Preprocessing adjustments including removing urls and other unnecessary characters. Needs to be cleaned up and feed into the model. 
[CodyAI](https://github.com/holdmydata/CodyAI) - Writing a GPT model from scratch. Using [Andrej Karpathy's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), will build off of this as I work toward a personal AI model. Notes added for my own learning.
## Next Steps
1. Understanding the encoder architecture, learn how it works, and add to model.
2. Research and build backend memory for the model. Vectorize dimensional databases. 
3. Panel/UI package for model training and evaluation.
